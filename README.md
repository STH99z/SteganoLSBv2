A small program can write files secretly into a BMP format file.
Always requires a BMP file named "in.bmp".

You can choose 0 to write or 1 to extract during the program running.

Write:
    requires an additional file, name it freely.
    type the file name when the program tells you.
    wait till finish.
    
    the hide file can't be to large for a BMP file to write.

Extract:
    requires nothing.
    wait till finish.

This version of program still has some bugs, but you won't encounter unless you play it inappropriately.

fuck how can i configure the right md file.......
